## Running the code
- Open in VS Code or favorite tools
    - I run WSL on Windows 11
    - I like a clean laptop with VS Code and WSL
    - I am a geek still :)
- Make sure you have `node`, `powershell` and `dotnet core` installed
    - Or cheat and use the `Azure Shell`
    - Create a free sandbox if you don't have one already
    - All of this goodness is already installed and ready to roll
- CD to the folder and soluion you want to test
    - csharp
        - `dotnet restore`
        - `dotnet build`
        - `dotnet run`
    - PowerShell
        - `./dayXX.ps1`
    - Node/JavaScript

## Day 02
X for Rock, Y for Paper, and Z for Scissors.

The winner of the whole tournament is the player with the highest score. Your total score is the sum of your scores for each round. The score for a single round is the score for the shape you selected (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, and 3 for Scissors) plus the score for the outcome of the round (0 if you lost, 3 if the round was a draw, and 6 if you won).
